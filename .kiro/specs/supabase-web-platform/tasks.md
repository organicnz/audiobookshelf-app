# Implementation Plan: Supabase Web Platform

## Overview

Migrate the Audiobookshelf client from a Nuxt 2 + Capacitor app to a fully web-native Nuxt 3 application deployed on Vercel, backed by Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL with RLS, Storage, and Realtime). The implementation proceeds in layers: project scaffolding → database → auth → library/items → file upload → audio player → progress sync → ebook readers → playlists/collections → preferences → PWA/offline → tests → deployment.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Scaffold Nuxt 3 project and configure core dependencies
  - Initialize a new Nuxt 3 project with TypeScript support (`nuxi init`)
  - Install and configure `@nuxtjs/supabase`, `@pinia/nuxt`, `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss`, and `@vite-pwa/nuxt`

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for a faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Property tests use `fast-check` with a minimum of 100 iterations each; each test file includes the tag comment `// Feature: supabase-web-platform, Property N: <property_text>`
- Unit and integration tests use Vitest; E2E tests use Playwright
- Integration tests require a local Supabase instance (`supabase start`)
- The Service Worker stores raw audio blobs under stable cache keys (not signed URLs, which expire) and intercepts Supabase Storage requests by path pattern
- All cache keys and storage paths are scoped to `{user_id}/` to prevent cross-user data access
- Capacitor native builds (Android/iOS) and Apple OAuth are explicitly deferred to a future phase
