---

## 📋 DAY-BY-DAY BREAKDOWN

### DAY 1: Foundation & Core Assembly (4 hours)

**🚀 ACCELERATED PATH:** All Swift files have been pre-generated in `docs/native-ios-example/`. You do NOT need to write code manually.

#### Hour 1: Project Setup

```bash
# 1. Open Xcode -> Create New Project -> iOS App
# 2. Product Name: AudiobookshelfClient
# 3. Organization Identifier: com.audiobookshelf
# 4. Interface: SwiftUI / Language: Swift
# 5. Create in your working directory

# 6. Create Group Structure in Xcode (right-click -> New Group):
#    - App
#    - Features
#      - Authentication
#      - Library
#      - Player
#      - Settings
#      - Search
#      - Downloads
#    - Components
#      - LiquidGlass
#      - Books
#      - Player
#      - Navigation
#      - UI
#      - Loading
#    - Services
#      - Networking
#      - Audio
#      - Socket
#      - Downloads
#    - Models
#    - Utilities
#    - Core
#      - Animation
#      - Graphics
#      - Effects
```

#### Hour 2-3: Copy Core Infrastructure

**Command Line (Fastest):**

```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd AudiobookshelfClient

# Copy source files from docs
cp -R ../docs/native-ios-example/App/ AudiobookshelfClient/App/
cp -R ../docs/native-ios-example/Core/ AudiobookshelfClient/Core/
cp -R ../docs/native-ios-example/Components/ AudiobookshelfClient/Components/
cp -R ../docs/native-ios-example/Features/ AudiobookshelfClient/Features/
cp -R ../docs/native-ios-example/Models/ AudiobookshelfClient/Models/
cp -R ../docs/native-ios-example/Services/ AudiobookshelfClient/Services/
cp -R ../docs/native-ios-example/Utilities/ AudiobookshelfClient/Utilities/

# IMPORTANT: Drag these folders into Xcode to link them!
```

**Manifest of Files to Link:**

1.  **App:** `AudiobookshelfApp.swift`
2.  **Core:** `ProMotionManager.swift`, `MetalContext.swift`, `ParallaxScrollView.swift`
3.  **Models:** `Models.swift`
4.  **Utilities:** `ColorExtractor.swift`, `NetworkMonitor.swift`, `TimeFormatter.swift`, `View+Extensions.swift`, `Constants.swift`
5.  **Services:**
    - `AudiobookshelfAPI.swift`
    - `AudioPlayerService.swift`
    - `DownloadService.swift`
    - `SocketService.swift`

#### Hour 4: Verify Compilation

1.  **Link Configuration:** Copy `docs/native-ios-example/Resources/Info.plist` to your project (drag and drop). This pre-configures:
    - Background Audio modes
    - Transport Security (Arbitrary Loads)
    - FaceID permissions
2.  **Verify:** Open project settings -> Info tab. Confirm `UIBackgroundModes` includes `audio`.
3.  **Run:** Build and Run (Cmd+R).
4.  You should see the "Connect" screen with Liquid Glass effects.

**END OF DAY 1 STATUS:** ✅ Fully compilable project ✅ Core services wired up ✅ Authentication flow ready ✅ Design system active

---

### DAY 2: Views & Features (6 hours)

**🚀 ACCELERATED PATH:** Continue linking the pre-generated files.

#### Hour 1-2: Core Views

1.  **Link Feature Configs:**

    - `Features/Authentication/Views/ConnectView.swift`
    - `Features/Library/Views/BookshelfView.swift`
    - `Features/Library/Views/BookDetailView.swift`
    - `Features/Player/Views/AudioPlayerView.swift`
    - `Features/Settings/Views/SettingsView.swift`
    - `Features/Search/Views/SearchView.swift`
    - `Features/Downloads/Views/DownloadsView.swift`

2.  **Link Components:**
    - `Components/LiquidGlass/GlassNavigationBar.swift`
    - `Components/Books/BookCard.swift`
    - `Components/Books/BookCoverView.swift`
    - `Components/Player/MiniPlayerView.swift`
    - `Components/Player/ChapterListView.swift`
    - `Components/Player/PlaybackSpeedView.swift`
    - `Components/Player/SleepTimerView.swift`
    - `Components/UI/StatusBadge.swift`
    - `Components/Loading/LoadingView.swift`

#### Hour 3: Configuration

**Update `AudiobookshelfApp.swift` if not already correctly linked:**

Ensure the `MainTabView` correctly references all the views you just linked.

```swift
// Check for this structure in AudiobookshelfApp.swift
if authManager.isAuthenticated {
    MainTabView() // This handles the TabBar navigation
} else {
    ConnectView() // Login screen
}
```

**END OF DAY 2 DELIVERABLE:** ✅ Full UI implementation ✅ Navigation working ✅ All screens built with Liquid Glass ✅ Player UI connected to service

---

### DAY 3: Polish & Deploy (4 hours)

#### Hour 1: Asset Setup

1.  **App Icon:** Generate a glass-style app icon using the logo.
2.  **Launch Screen:** Add a simple gradient background to matches the app theme.

#### Hour 2: Testing

1.  **Simulator:** Test on iPhone 15 Pro (Simulates Dynamic Island).
2.  **Device:** Run on real device to test Metal performance.
3.  **Audio:** Verify background audio functionality (lock screen controls).

#### Hour 3: TestFlight

1.  Create App Store Connect app entry.
2.  Archive in Xcode (Product -> Archive).
3.  Upload to TestFlight.
4.  Invite internal testers.
